-Hi, y'all the name's Noa, this will be my first aproach to my final destination, the wonderfull world of programming.

About me
♫. I'm someone who we're looking for something to fulfill my life, that was the programming, looking for being a FrontEnd & BackEnd developer at the same time
   learning Security.

♫. With knowledge in English, dreaming about someday being a C2 certificated someday.

♫. My main objective today is to surpass, someone I consider like my model person and my master, and I will.

Make my words.
